# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Dates are ISO. This project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org): breaking changes to the config file,
the CLI surface, or the entry format bump the major.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-28

First release. Under development and largely untested — see the warning at the
top of the README.

### Added

- Full-screen overlay: search, copy, type, fill-login, reveal, and a detail pane
  that does not decrypt until gpg-agent is already warm.
- Bar widget with a search pulldown for the quick path.
- Create, edit, generate, rename and delete entries, so the `pass` CLI is
  optional.
- One-time codes via `pass-otp`: copy, type, and QR enrolment that reads the
  code off the screen without the image touching disk.
- Fingerprint unlock in front of the vault when a finger is enrolled, using
  Omarchy's own PAM service.
- Guided first-run setup, and a startup check of all eight requirements that
  shows the exact command fixing each missing one.
- `omapass-reset` for exercising the setup flow repeatedly, backing up the store
  and the GPG key before it removes either.
- A config file at `~/.config/omapass/config`.
- `tests/smoke.sh`.

### Security

- Copy, type, login and OTP never bring a secret into the long-lived shell
  process; the helper pipes it from gpg straight to `wl-copy` or `wtype`.
- Secrets travel over stdin and in shell variables, never in argv.
- The clipboard is marked sensitive, so Omarchy's clipboard manager will not
  record it, and the selection is dropped after a timeout.
